# Unit 2: User Methods

In Unit 2, you will make user information more public.  The template used by the GenericApp gem is based on the assumption that user privacy should be protected.  Erring on the pro-privacy side is a feature and not a bug of the Rails Neutrino project that creates the GenericApp template app.  First, it's better to err on the side of maintaining user privacy than to err in the opposite direction.  Second, it's easier to expand visibility than it is to curtail it.

In the chapters of Unit 2, you will make users visible to other users, give users gravatars, and allow users to follow other users.

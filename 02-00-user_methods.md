# Unit 2: User Methods

In Unit 2, you will update the user methods.  The template used by the GenericApp gem is based on the assumption that user privacy should be protected.  This assumption is much less valid for this app, because interaction among users is desired.  Thus, users should be able to view the profiles of other users.

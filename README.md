# Ruby on Racetracks Tutorial: Ruby Users of Minnesota

Welcome to the [Ruby on Racetracks](http://www.rubyonracetracks.com/) Tutorial on creating your own version of the Ruby Users of Minnesota (Ruby.MN) site.

## What's the Point?
In this tutorial, you will learn a step-by-step process of creating a Rails app and adding object classes to it.  This tutorial is inspired by Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial.  Like Rails Tutorial, this tutorial uses test-driven development and Minitest for testing.  Unlike Rails Tutorial, this site has much shorter chapters so that you don't lose track of what you're doing.  In the unlikely event that you do mess up, you realize this quickly and can easily troubleshoot.

## What does this app do?
This app allows Ruby.MN to credit its current and past sponsors.  Users can share information on job openings, their qualifications for jobs, and projects that they're working on.

## Prerequisites
* Docker should be installed.  This is covered in the [Docker Tutorial](https://github.com/jhsu802701/tutorial-docker-stretch).
* You should have one of my rbenv-general Docker images installed.  This is covered in the [Docker Tutorial](https://github.com/jhsu802701/tutorial-docker-stretch).
* You should be familiar with the process of creating a new Rails app.  This is covered in the [GenericApp Tutorial](https://gist.github.com/jhsu802701/ace85adf7c3f197391c4457dec863e89).
